# Air-quality-monitoring-system
I independently developed an indoor air quality monitoring system using an Arduino board and sensors to measure temperature, humidity, CO2, and VOCs. I programmed BLE functionality for real-time data transmission to mobile devices and created a user-friendly interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for seamless data visualization.
